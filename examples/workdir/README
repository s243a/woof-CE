You can copy these files into your working directory to help with building your woofnext puppy. 

THe files are:
make_sfs_fm_rootfs.sh -- This file uses woof-next on an already
         built sfs to modify the rootsfs and than build the iso
make-sfs-fm-rootfs.sh -- This is the code extracted from woof
         next to make the sfs file. You can use, mount_chroot-ascii-x86
         to modify the rootfs before building the file.
update-puppy-skeleton -- This will update the files in puppy-skeleton
         from woof-CE based on the files in tazcore_noarch
mount_chroot-ascii-x86 -- use this script to mount the rootfs and make
        changes prior to building the iso.
