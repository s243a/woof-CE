A puppy built by Woof can have a custom logo in this directory.

The name format is:

${DISTRO_FILE_PREFIX}48.png
${DISTRO_FILE_PREFIX}96.png

The build script '3builddistro' will automatically replace
puppylogo48.png and puppylogo96.png with your correct logo,
then delete this 'puplogos' directory.
