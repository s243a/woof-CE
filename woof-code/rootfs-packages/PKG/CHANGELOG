1.9.22

* (HEAD -> master, tag: v1.9.22, origin/master, origin/HEAD) bumped version to 1.9.22
* updated README
* fix TAB completion: use default behaviour, PLUS the custom `_pkg` func: * this fixes TAB completion for things like: `pkg contents ../[TAB]` * in other words, TAB completion of files and dirs now fixes :)
* better spacing in `pkg status <pkgname>` output for descriptions and deps: * align with first line if deps/desc spans multiple lines
* fixes to search commands: Users can now pass multiple searches at once - simple pass them on a new line, inside doulb quote:
* fix for "command_not_found_handle" failing to initialise peroperl
* small clean up and speed up in list_deps(): * cleaner checking of builtins and devs packages
* speed ups in list_deps: * properly use the "deps_done" file to skip deps already checked * other fixes
* suppress sed errors from list_deps() in pkg_status().. also remove useless cats in which_pkg()
* fixed: list_deps() was listing duplicates
* speed up in list_deps(): * removed a call to `get_pkg_name_only` * check package is builtin before blacklisted
* small cleanups: removed some useless cats
* small fixes: remove useless `cat`s from list_deps(): * and a few other small speed ups as well (dont make much difference, but...)
* fix pkg_entry() failure to process multiples packages from stdin: * was using exit 0 instead of return 0 in pkg_entry() func after successfully printing 1st repo entry..fixed
* fixes in pkg_download(): use wget to check server, not ping, better skipping of invalid URLs: These changes fix downloading URLs from http://bear.alienbase.nl/mirrors/slackware/slackware-current/
* updated first_run info to show `pkg add` command, not the older (but still supported) `pkg get`
* fixes in pkg_status() and list_deps() commands: * fix pkg_status not finding category, deps and repo file of packages in "other" repos * fix list_deps() listing duplicates packages
* updates to bash completion script: * fixes `pkg status <pkgname`: get pkg names to complete from all repos * add "rm" command to completions.. do `pkg rm[TAB]` to see all installed packages
* fixes package repo entry command (`pkg pe <pkgname>`): * always match full package name before trying to match PKGNAME_ONLY * only sohw first match
* fix in TAB completion: `pkg usage na[TAB]` will list only pkg commands starting with "na"
* fixes in TAB completion: * if completing a Pkg command (install/add/rm/search/etc), dont include package names * fix `pkg usa[TAB]` not giving `pkg usage`
* fix previous commit:
* fix list all available repos.. improves `names-all`, `which-repo`, more..
* added patch to stay up-to-date with Woof2/petget: - added support for new var $NO_MULTIARCH_SYMLINK in /etc/DISTRO_SPECS
* added a little more help info to the installer
* Fixes for installing local.deb packages when they are not in $WORKDIR

* updated installre.sh
* minor updates in menu entries and READMEs...   and added .sh extension to /usr/share/pkg/command_not_found_handle.sh
* Fixed: set --prefix through `pkg build` command: - use `pkg build PKGNAME --configure="--prefix=/usr/local"` and the --prefix option will now work with all (?) buildscripts. - note, must be using BUILDTOOL=buildpet in ~/.pkg/pkgrc for this to work
* Fixes in Petbuild init, and updates in Buildpet (better --config parsing, package naming supports more recent pups)
* fixed `pkg LI <pkgname>` not filtering results
* fixed READMEs (removed "$SELF" references)
* fixes and improvements for command_not_found_handle
* New feature: show package suggestions on missing commands: - new file: /usr/share/pkg/command_not_found_handle - enable with `source /usr/share/pkg/command_not_found_handle` - disable with `unset command_not_found_handle` - ...also updated READMEs
* updated env vars help output to include PKGRC

* fixes in pkg_contents()
* moved /usr/lib/pkg to /usr/share/pkg, other small fixes
* moved /usr/lib/pkg to /usr/share/pkg
* fixes in artful and bionic repo sources: - removed extra pipe, had 1 too many after the URLs - was causing fallback to be missed
* Improve Buildpet package compiling: You can now set the following environment variables to override the `configure` and `make` options: - PKG_CONFIGURE="--prefix=/usr/local" pkg build xarchiver - PKG_CFLAGS="-02" pkg build xarchiver
* fix indentation in code
* added extra text for pkg URLs, quit earlier if there is an error
* extra checks for pkg URL, show URL in console output
* fixes to sources-all for ubuntu pups: - re-ordered the mirror URLs, added extra mirror to zesty, precise, trusty
* fixes for Xenial repos in `sources-all`: - use noarch common as first fallbacks
* added Puppy Artful and Bionic support: - added new repos to /etc/sources-all and ~/.pkg/sources-all - added common32 and common64 repos as well - fixed ubuntu repo downloads (changed mirrors from filearena.net to archive.ubuntu.com)
* fixes in [X]pkgdialog: - choosing multiple pkgs works again - using --quiet for nicer output/logging
* small cleanup in TAB autocomplete script
* fixes in listing all installed pkgs inc builtins: `pkg LI [pkgname]` now much faster, no pkg sorting, no calling twice
* added --quiet, --no-colour to autocomplete script - previous commit also fixes rdep-check option complete, BTW
* fixes in TAB auto completion: - faster - now supports dashless commands like `pkg status <pkgname>` - added some missing options and cmds
* fix for previous commit
* improvements in pkg_combine(): - use pkg_unpack() - get each post-install script, append to a new pinstall.sh script - this makes the combined packages more reliable and correct - as the post install routines of the package and its deps gets included in the combined package
* fixes previous commit
* fixes and clean up in get_pkg_ext(), get_pkg_version(), set_config() and pkg_update(): - this improves `pkg update <pkgname` and `pkg update` commands - also improves grabbing package version from $PKGNAME - only tested on a .deb based Puppy so far!
* more readable console output for `pkg update [pkgname]`
 * prevents align-1.7.5 returning its name twice - pkg_update() now installs the new package, and its new deps - builtin packages cannot be updated:   * user gest a messa
ge saying the builtin will be skipped
* efa5961 - fix in dir2pet for no arch packages
* improvements in dir2pet(): - if no pet.specs in the package dir, build one - asks user for category, description and deps (all optional) - ..but if pet.specs
does exist in the package dir, just build PET, no questions - also now using get_pkg_version, which supports more package types
* improvements to `pkg ldd <pkgname>`: - search package and its deps - search /sbin/ and /games/ too - nicer output - cleaner code - now works as advertised
* fixes in `pkg --deps-check <pkgname>`: - fixed calling without -- - fixed finding *.files in ~/.packages if partial pkg name given - added alias ldd for deps-
check - so can now do this: `pkg ldd <pkgname>` - will report any bins or libs in pkgname that have missing libs
* very small code clean ups
* fixes in `pkg update <pkgname>`: - moved getting package version into its own func - has better support for different package types - fix `pkg update` (withou
t passing $1), checks all installed packages - fix `pkg update PKGNAME` checks only given package name
* fix, exit quicker in pkg_remove() when package not installed
* fixed for previous commit
* code clean up
* small fix: updated usage menu
* added new commands: `pkg add` and `pkg remove`: - `pkg add PKGNAME` is just an alias for `pkg get`, and works the same - `pkg remove PKGNAME` uninstalls a pac
kage, and its unused, left over deps - can also use `pkg rm PKGNAME` too - updated help info, usage docs and example commands to match - added some advanced example comma
nds too
* fixes for --ask and --force options: - only ask user once at start to install/download a pkg - only ask user once at start to get a pkg and its deps - only as
k user once at start to get pkg deps - fixed --force option with download command - so using --force to download will re-download a pkg, not skip it
* a couple of tiny code clean ups
* added support for blacklisted packages: - get PKG_NAME_IGNORE from /root/.packages/PKGS_MANAGEMENT - skip/ignore pkgd and deps in various places if found in $
PKG_NAME_IGNORE
* fixes and updates to Gpkgdialog: - fixes pkgs not installing properly if not in WORKDIR - fixes output and logging of installs, uninstalls etc - uses new --qu
iet option added to Pkg - added option to force (re-)install of package - added option to install pkg at bottom of package status window
* Add LICENSE

1.9.17
- new: allow override default rc file location (~/.pkg/pkgrc) with $PKGRC env var
- new: `pkg --what-needs PKGNAME`, list the pkgs that depend on PKGNAME .. (reverse dep lookup)

	`pkg --usage <option>`
	- added support for short options (-li,-pi,-ps,-ld,-le, etc)
	- added usage info for the various supported environment vars
	- added example cmds to usage output of given cmd, taken from /usr/lib/pkg/docs/examples.txt

- improvement: `pkg -la` (delete all pkgs in WORKDIR) will confirm before deleting all pkgs
- small fixes, clean ups and updates in man page, README, help text.
- fixed: create layers-installed [inc devx pkgs if devx loaded] on Pkg load
    * this also helps removes PetGet as a dependency of Pkg

    * supports passing multiple PKGs to most options, with or without quotes
    * PKGs can be delimited (separated) by space, comma (or a pipe when in quotes)
    * you can still pipe (newline or space delimited) lists into Pkg if you give dash (-) as its last option:
	example: `echo geany vlc | pkg -PS -` will print status of both pkgs
    * if piping stuff, use -ss and -ssa for pipe-able search output (-s and -s produce fancy ouput)
- fixed: include devx pkgs in `pkg -LI`, which should list ALL installed pkgs
- fixes in finding where pkg comes from:
    * same fixes applied to: is_usr_pkg(), is_devx_pkg(), is_builtin_pkg(), is_repo_pkg(), is_installed_pkg()
- fixed repo_file_list(): takes repo name returns name of its repo file,
    * fixed a failure to return the correct, matching repo file in some cases
- fixes in pkg_status():
    * show correct install status (user,devx,builtin,layers)
    * fixed missing repo filenames (see repo_file_list)
    * standardise output: add 'K' to end of $pkg_size, if not already there



1.9.14
- fixed list_dependants(): don't include the pkg being checked in the list, only its dependants
- fix pkg_download(): nicer output when using --ask
    * if not called with --ask, then always hide question tags
    * this fixes internal funcs calls where Pkg disables $ASK internally, but user gave --ask option
- fix pkg_combine(): fixed some breaking changes from last version, added support for --ask and including BUILTINS
    * Use  `pkg --pkg-combine|-pc`  to combine a pkg with its deps, not including builtins.
    * Prefix above cmd with  HIDE_BUILTINS=false  to include builtins too

- cleanup naming of functions, more consistent
- cleanup CLI interace: fixed usage msgs not showing, fixed opts not accepting multiple pkgs
- cleanup code, moved help info to /usr/lib/pkg/docs/, source it in Pkg
- much nicer usage info: moved into /usr/lib/pkg/docs/usage/<cmd_name>
    * give cmd (--get, --download, etc) without options to see its usage info
    * or use `pkg --usage|-usage [CMD]` to see list or usage of available commands

1.9.13

    # --force will not install or uninstall builtins (that is coming soon..)

1.9.12

    # --list-deps default behaviour is still to "list all deps of pkg (not inc builtins)"
    # --list-installed default behaviour is still to "list all installed pkgs (not inc builtins)"
    # but they now support the env vars: HIDE_USER_PKGS, HIDE_BUILTINS [true or false] ..
    # Pkg users can use these in combination to show all, only missing, already builtin, etc
    # EG:
     HIDE_USER_PKGS=true  HIDE_BUILTINS=true  pkg -le PKGNAME	# list only deps not yet installed:
     HIDE_USER_PKGS=true  HIDE_BUILTINS=false pkg -le PKGNAME   # list only the deps of PKGNAME that are already built in
     HIDE_USER_PKGS=false HIDE_BUILTINS=false pkg -le PKGNAME 	# list all deps of PKGNAME (as listed in its repo, inc builtins)
     HIDE_USER_PKGS=false HIDE_BUILTINS=false pkg -li PKGNAME 	# list all installed pkgs, inc builtins
     ...etc

- fix pkg_repack(), add build number to created PET
	# get build number from pkgs repo entry, increment it, add to end of pkg name
- fixes in get_pkg_name()
	# make sure to search user installed pkgs first

	# added missing entry for txz2* cmds

1.9.3

- fixed default settings in rc file:
   # fix prevent correct dep search in first run
   # updated, DEPSEARCH='list_all_pkg_names' by default

- fixes in dep resolution:
   # much faster, less looping, checks fewer deps, more reliable:
   # now filtering out installed pkgs in find_deps() and list_deps() all in one go
   # so `pkg --list-deps PKGNAME` now lists missing deps, not all deps.
   # the same for `pkg --pkg-status PKGNAME` .. only lists missing deps
